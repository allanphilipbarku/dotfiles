# Personal Dotfiles


- `.zshrc`: My personal config for [oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). For reference, you can find the original `.zshrc` file [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/templates/zshrc.zsh-template).
- `.vimrc`: My vim config based on [this Laracasts series](https://laracasts.com/series/vim-mastery)
- `.gitignore`: Global gitignore file. See [this link](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/setting-up-a-global-gitignore-file/) for info.


If you want to share your dotfiles, check out [this article here](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/move-your-dotfiles-version-control) which explains how to do it.

I've also added my Visual Studio Code settings, keybindings and snippets which you can find in the `vscode` folder.

## Inspiration

Looking at other people's dotfiles can give you ideas that you can incorporate into your setup. Here are some that I've looked into:
